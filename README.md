In order to run a google chrome extension you are required to have all the files related to it(manifest.json,png icon,browser action html file and the scripting files) in the same directory.

Then visit "Chrome://extensions" and click on "Load unpacked extension" and select the file you want from the browsing window. 

Below is a detailed description of the functionality of our extension:

1) Send Email
            - Send email is a simple google extension that uses either gmail or your default mail handler to send an email consisting of your current page to whomever you desire. 
            - If in a broswer session, it sends the search query as the subject with the URL as the mail content. 
            - A requirement is that the user is already logged in to whatever email client they wish to use.
